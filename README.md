Connectivity Index Calculation:

MRT Stations (35%): Density of MRT stations within each area

Bus Stops (30%): Density of bus stops relative to population

Carparks (20%): Available parking facilities per capita

Taxi Availability (15%): Real-time taxi density in each planning area

Scoring: Each component is scored 0-100, then weighted to produce the final connectivity index. Areas with scores 80+ are considered to have excellent connectivity, while scores below 20 indicate areas that need infrastructure improvement.
