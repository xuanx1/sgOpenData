[{"id":344210054,"title":"Trump calls Epstein case a 'witch hunt', urges Maxwell cooperation with DOJ","text":"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Tuesday (Jul 22) said it would be appropriate for prosecutors to interview Ghislaine Maxwell, calling the continued scrutiny of the late Jeffrey Epstein’s sex-trafficking case a “witch hunt”.\n\n“I think it’s time to hear everything. It’s a witch hunt against the wrong people. Let’s get to the truth,” Trump said in the Oval Office, referencing public pressure from his supporters to unseal additional Epstein case records.\n\nThe remarks came as the Justice Department confirmed it had asked Maxwell’s legal team whether she would be willing to speak with prosecutors, with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche saying he expected to meet with her “in the coming days”.\n\nMaxwell, a British socialite and former associate of Epstein, is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence after being convicted in 2021 of helping Epstein recruit and groom underage girls for abuse.\n\n“President Trump has told us to release all credible evidence,” Blanche posted on X, formerly Twitter. “If Ms Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and DOJ will hear what she has to say.”\n\nJULY 29 DEADLINE SET\n\nTwo federal judges in New York on Tuesday gave the Justice Department until Jul 29 to provide detailed arguments justifying its request to unseal grand jury records tied to the Epstein and Maxwell cases.\n\nThey also instructed parties in the case, including Maxwell, a representative for Epstein, and alleged victims, to submit their positions on the matter by Aug 5.\n\nIn a statement, Maxwell’s attorney David Oscar Markus confirmed they were in talks with prosecutors. “Ghislaine will always testify truthfully. We are grateful to President Trump for his commitment to uncovering the truth in this case.”\n\nMaxwell did not testify at her trial and is appealing her conviction to the US Supreme Court.","summary":"","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/world\/trump-calls-epstein-case-witch-hunt-urges-maxwell-cooperation-doj-5252481","image":"https:\/\/dam.mediacorp.sg\/image\/upload\/s--9E4hQfgo--\/c_crop,h_449,w_799,x_1,y_283\/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:ap_data-1,w_0.1\/f_auto,q_auto\/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600\/v1\/one-cms\/core\/britain_trump_epstein_90512.jpg?itok=uJWMGpH5","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-22 18:10:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":0.004,"authors":null},{"id":344210052,"title":"Ozzy Osbourne, Black Sabbath’s bat-biting frontman, dies aged 76","text":"LONDON: Ozzy Osbourne, the heavy metal icon and frontman of British rock band Black Sabbath, has died at the age of 76, the BBC reported on Tuesday (Jul 22), citing a statement from his family.\n\nNicknamed the \"Prince of Darkness\" and the \"Godfather of Heavy Metal\", Osbourne rose to fame in the 1970s with hits such as Paranoid, War Pigs and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. Known for his distinctive voice, theatrical performances and dark, riff-driven sound, he sold more than 100 million records worldwide across his career.\n\nOsbourne earned notoriety in 1982 after biting the head off a bat thrown on stage by a fan – an incident he said he mistook for a toy before rushing to hospital for a rabies shot. He later embraced the moment, selling bat-themed merchandise including plush toys with removable heads.\n\nHis wild lifestyle, fuelled by years of drug and alcohol abuse, made him a target for conservative and religious groups, who accused him of promoting harmful messages. Osbourne denied accusations of devil worship, saying in his 2010 biography: “I've done some bad things in my time. But I ain't the devil. I'm just John Osbourne: a working class kid from Aston who quit his job in the factory and went looking for a good time.”\n\nBorn John Michael Osbourne, he grew up in the working-class neighbourhood of Aston in Birmingham, England, the fourth of six children. He struggled with dyslexia, left school at 15, and cycled through a series of jobs before serving a brief prison sentence for burglary. His life changed when he joined Black Sabbath in 1969.\n\n“I wouldn’t have put money on me making it to 60,” he said later. “No way.”\n\nA new generation came to know Osbourne in the 2000s through the reality TV show The Osbournes, which chronicled his domestic life with wife Sharon and children Jack, Kelly and Aimee. The show, which premiered in 2002, portrayed the rock star in a softer light and gained a large following.\n\nHe is survived by Sharon, their children, and several grandchildren.","summary":"","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/world\/ozzy-osbourne-black-sabbaths-bat-biting-frontman-dies-aged-76-5252566","image":"https:\/\/dam.mediacorp.sg\/image\/upload\/s--1eJXlk-Y--\/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:ap_data-1,w_0.1\/f_auto,q_auto\/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600\/v1\/one-cms\/core\/obit_ozzy_osbourne_79653.jpg?itok=z1IpQyrP","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-22 18:44:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":null,"source_country":"sg","sentiment":0.309,"authors":null},{"id":344210048,"title":"World Athletics releases annual sustainability report for events","text":"World Athletics on Tuesday released its first annual review assessing meets against its \"Athletics for a Better World\" standard, designed to minimise environmental impact while enhancing social and local economic benefits.\n\nThe sustainability report categorised events from 2024 into five achievement levels - platinum, gold, silver, bronze and recognised - based on compliance with the ABW standard.\n\n\"The World Athletics Indoor Championships Glasgow 24 and the Oslo Bislett Games achieved platinum, and the Hypo-Meeting combined events meeting in Gotzis, Austria, and the Weltklasse Zurich achieved gold,\" World Athletics said in a statement.\n\nThe review, which looked at reports from 102 events from 36 countries, found that 48 meets reached one of the achievement levels.\n\n\"It’s a start our entire sport can be proud of,\" World Athletics president Sebastian Coe said in a statement.\n\n“We knew from experience and discussions with organisers that sustainability planning and reporting does require an allocation of additional time, resources and expertise.

Such arguments “will absolutely have ripple effects on litigation against corporate actors”, Chowdhury said.\n\nAt the same hearing, China, the world’s largest emitter of greenhouse gases followed by the United States, said that the United Nations climate change negotiation mechanism should be the primary channel for global climate governance.\n\nSimilarly, the US told the Court that it should rely on the Paris Agreement and not establish further obligations than the ones negotiated by states.\n\nNinety-eight countries presented statements on what obligations they think states should have in tackling climate change. The series of hearings was the culmination of years of campaigning by a group of students from Pacific nations and a coalition of small island states and vulnerable countries that sought to clarify the legal responsibilities of nation-states in relation to climate change.\n\nLatin America’s Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea previously issued advisory opinions on how countries must monitor corporate activities, especially those that generate greenhouse gases, and the same will be expected for the ICJ, said Chowdhury.\n\nAdvisory opinion to fill the “gap” left by COPs\n\nThe ICJ’s advisory opinion is as another potential avenue to advance the case for climate reparations, where climate negotiations have failed, suggested the speakers at the online briefing.\n\nThe hearings that would lead to the advisory opinion were championed by states because multilateralism, while still important, has not delivered at the scale necessary, said Chowdhury.\n\n“The gap that we’re seeing between countries, policies, laws and what science and climate justice requires is unquestionable,” she said. “States turned to the court because they wanted clarity on what the international legal obligations of states are in relation to climate change. We really hope [the advisory opinion] will help break open some of the issues that have really stalled in negotiations.”\n\nThe advisory opinion’s clarification on the consequences for states failing to act on climate change issues will be “the foundation to guide the work forward” beyond COPs, added Prasad.\n\n“The advisory opinion could broaden the scope of environmental law and affirm its status as an integral part of international law,” said Astrid Puentes Riaño, UN special rapporteur on the human right to a healthy environment, who was also present at the briefing.\n\n“It would clarify that environmental obligations are interconnected with all state actions, including economic and development policies.

Yet with the US withdrawing from the agreement, and deepening trade tensions between the West and China, international cooperation is on shaky ground.\n\nThere is a key opportunity for renewed engagement in late July at the EU-China Summit, preceded by the EU-China High-Level Environment and Climate Dialogue. In previous years, bilateral meetings between the US and China often paved the way for breakthroughs in international climate policy.\n\nAmid the geopolitical turmoil presided over by US President Donald Trump, there is a vacuum to be filled for the EU and China. The talks in July have the potential to build some much-needed momentum on the road to new and updated national climate targets, which are expected at the UN General Assembly in September.\n\nThe EU has a chance to raise the stakes, but this will hinge on the role that the new German government is willing to play. How will it reshape its relationship with China bilaterally? Can it help build a majority among EU member states in time for ambitious 2035 climate targets?\n\nTargets for 2040 are also in the balance, as the EU Commission has formally proposed a legally binding target for the bloc of a 90 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, compared to 1990 levels. A decision is expected on that after the summer break. A positive outcome will require a qualified majority among EU member states.\n\nWhat the new chancellor’s leadership means for relations with China\n\nGermany’s approach to China is expected to see yet another change under the new chancellor, Friedrich Merz. During her tenure in 2005-2021, Angela Merkel had cultivated a “special relationship” with Beijing, emphasising pragmatic cooperation and regular institutionalised dialogues.\n\nOlaf Scholz largely continued along this path in 2021-2025 while cautiously integrating “de-risking” into German policy. Merz, who comes from the conservative CDU party, has indicated that he will take de-risking to the next level. A position paper published by the CDU\/CSU parliamentary group in 2023 set out long-term and strategic priorities to safeguard German industrial competitiveness.\n\nIt signalled a more hawkish stance on issues related to industry and trade interests. This aligns with broader EU efforts to shield the internal market and key industries from Chinese competition.\n\nA more assertive stance still allows room for pragmatism, particularly in sectors like clean tech, where German industry remains tightly interwoven with Chinese supply chains and manufacturing ecosystems. German companies stand to benefit from collaboration with Chinese ones when it comes to mutual technology transfer and investment in cutting-edge tech.\n\nAt the same time, pressure is building across German industry for stronger defensive measures. An influential industry association, the German Engineering Federation (VDMA), has issued a position paper urging the government and EU to adopt tougher industrial policies to counter what it sees as unfair competition.\n\nAs such, a dual-track strategy is likely to emerge, with more assertive protection of domestic industries alongside openness for collaboration where it benefits both sides, particularly in areas such as clean technologies.\n\nIndeed, Chancellor Merz and President Xi Jinping’s initial phone call after the German election underscored the importance of sustained dialogue. Both leaders mentioned climate change as a key area for cooperation.\n\nThe call suggests that, despite friction in other domains, climate could remain a stabilising force in the relationship. In the China strategy of the previous administration, published in 2023 and a first for a German government, climate cooperation was also defined as a focus area of bilateral engagement.\n\nThis strategy received a fair bit of criticism. It was accused of being too much effort for too little reward for the several ministries involved in creating it across a troubled coalition, and for in the end being more of a position paper than a strategy.\n\nHowever, the new German government in its coalition treaty announced that it would “revise” the China strategy “in line with the principle of ‘de-Risking’”. It remains to be seen what balance this revision will strike between climate cooperation and de-risking.\n\nA first test will come with the bilateral government consultations that were a defining feature of Merkel’s China policy. These roughly biennial meetings involved state leaders and ministers of an exclusive group of partner countries. They happened once more with China under the auspices of Scholz in Berlin in 2023.\n\nDue to take place again this year, it would be telling if Merz allowed the tradition to die out. Rather than merely keeping it alive, he could choose to make the exchange more European by inviting representatives from other member states, notably France. That country has recently increased its efforts to engage with China on environmental and climate issues.\n\nClimate policy under the new German government\n\nMerz sees climate change as a serious problem, but the approach of his government is expected to be quite different to that of his predecessor. The coalition’s treaty laid out the legislative ambition of the partnership of the Conservatives (CDU\/CSU) with the Social Democrats (SPD).\n\nIt indicates a shifting focus from regulatory approaches to market-based instruments, competitiveness and technological innovation. This includes support for controversial technical solutions that have limited proven viability, such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS). Interestingly, the positioning of technical innovation and green industrial policy as the preferred solutions to reduce emissions has parallels with elements of China’s own climate strategy.","summary":"In this moment of geopolitical flux and climate urgency, the new German government can act as a vital broker between Europe and China.","url":"https:\/\/www.eco-business.com\/news\/germany-must-seize-the-chance-to-engage-china-on-climate-action\/","image":"https:\/\/eco-business.imgix.net\/ebmedia\/fileuploads\/henry-chen-OF8MM3_Glrc-unsplash.jpg?fit=crop&h=960&ixlib=django-1.2.0&w=1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 22:05:00","author":"Belinda Schäpe, Martin Voss, Barbara Pongratz","language":"en","category":null,"source_country":"sg","sentiment":0.14,"authors":["Belinda Schäpe, Martin Voss, Barbara Pongratz"]},{"id":343675100,"title":"Man who got into two sham marriages for money gets jail","text":"SINGAPORE: In order to pay off his debts, a man entered into two sham marriages one after the other, gave his Singpass credentials away and hired a maid in his name even though she performed cleaning work elsewhere.\n\nGoh Cheng Feng, Alex, 31, was sentenced on Monday (Jul 21) to 20 months and six weeks' imprisonment and fined S$18,000 (US$14,000). If he cannot pay the fine, he will have to serve another 36 days' jail in default.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to seven charges under the Immigration Act linked to the sham marriages, Computer Misuse Act for relinquishing his Singpass information and Employment of Foreign Manpower Act for the maid offences.\n\nAnother 12 charges were taken into consideration.\n\nThe court heard that Goh came to know a person called Jason in 2021 through playing poker. Jason was later established to be Ng Chee Hon, a Singaporean who is at large.\n\nDuring the games, Jason raised the idea of a marriage of convenience with a Vietnamese woman to prolong her stay in Singapore, asking Goh to consider it.\n\nSometime between end-2022 and early 2023, Goh owed Jason money for losing a poker game hosted by Jason.\n\nJason then repeated the sham marriage proposal to Goh. He was to act as his foreign spouse's local sponsor and apply for visit passes for her to remain in Singapore.\n\nJason also said Goh would get a divorce if the long-term visit pass application for his spouse was rejected.\n\nIn return, he would be paid S$4,000 on the day of solemnisation, S$1,000 every month after solemnisation and S$6,000 on approval of the long-term visit pass.\n\nNeeding money, Goh agreed. He got married to Dolly Luong Gia Linh, a 24-year-old Vietnamese woman, solemnising their marriage in April 2023 at Hard Rock Hotel in Sentosa.\n\nHe received the S$4,000 from Dolly after the ceremony. They did not stay together and did not have a real marriage.\n\nGoh made an application for a long-term visit pass for Dolly, but it was rejected in June 2023. He made an appeal, but this was also rejected.\n\nDolly later told Goh that she would initiate proceedings to dissolve the marriage, as Goh could not get the pass for her and there was no reason to continue with it.\n\nGoh was told he would continue to get the monthly payment of S$1,000 and was asked to apply for a short-term visit pass for Dolly to remain in Singapore until the marriage was dissolved.\n\nThe annulment was finalised in December 2023. By then, Goh had successfully made five short-term visit pass applications for Dolly, failing three others.\n\nTo avoid leaving evidence, Goh deleted messages and photos of the sham marriage arrangement. He was also approached by Jason to act as a witness for someone else's sham marriage and received S$100 for that as a \"transportation fee\".\n\nIn total, Goh received S$11,500 from Dolly for the marriage of convenience.\n\nTHE SECOND MARRIAGE\n\nIn January 2024, Jason and Dolly offered Goh proposals to enter into a second sham marriage under the same terms.\n\nInitially, Goh rejected them, but eventually agreed as he wanted to pay off his debt.\n\nDolly linked Goh up with his second wife - 31-year-old Vietnamese national Phan Thi Trang.\n\nThey got married at a restaurant at Marina Bay Sands in March 2024 and Goh received S$2,950 in total from Dolly and Jason as his reward.\n\nDolly then told Goh that she would pay him S$6,000 if he succeeded in getting a long-term visit pass for his second wife.\n\nHe submitted an application, lying in the declarations, but it was rejected by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) in June 2024.\n\nOther than these offences, Goh also agreed to employ a foreign domestic worker under his name - a ploy suggested by Jason in December 2023.\n\nUnder the arrangement, the maid would carry out freelance cleaning work in Singapore, and Goh would be paid S$1,200 for every maid he employed.\n\nTo facilitate this, Goh made a false statement to the Ministry of Manpower to employ a maid. Although the maid was issued a work pass, she never worked for him.\n\nInstead, she did freelance home cleaning services between April 2024 and December 2024, renting rooms in Housing Board flats for between S$500 and S$600 a month instead of staying with Goh.\n\nGoh also admitted disclosing the login credentials of his Singpass account to an unidentified person on Telegram for S$3,000 that he never received.\n\nUnknown criminals used his Singpass details to open bank accounts, with more than S$4 million flowing through them in total. More than S$440,000 of this money was linked to scams.\n\nICA arrested Goh in June 2024 for the sham marriage with Phan, while MOM began investigating him for the maid offence half a year later.\n\nGoh's lawyer, Mr Riko Isaac from Amolat & Partners, said his client was \"desperate for finances\" when he committed the offences.\n\nHe had lost his job in part due to COVID-19 as well as a failed business venture that wiped out his savings.\n\nThis led Goh to borrow from a bank and licensed moneylenders, causing his debt to swell to S$60,000, said Mr Isaac.\n\nHe was on the brink of bankruptcy when he spoke to Jason, who offered him \"easy money\".\n\nAs for the Singpass offence, Goh had been invited to join a Telegram group offering part-time work and Singpass-related scams were not as rampant back then as they are now, so he did not \"think too much\" about it, said Mr Isaac.","summary":"His first wife asked for an annulment as he could not get her a long-term visit pass.","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/singapore\/man-jail-two-sham-marriages-5249236","image":"https:\/\/dam.mediacorp.sg\/image\/upload\/s--rQCit8gu--\/f_auto,q_auto\/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600\/v1\/mediacorp\/cna\/image\/2023\/10\/19\/istock-79329260.jpg?itok=cGDIPX6Z","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 08:45:38","author":"Lydia Lam","language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.915,"authors":["Lydia Lam"]},{"id":344004776,"title":"Wallabies look to get Suaalii more involved in second Lions test","text":"TCF vendors\n\nExponential Interactive, Inc d\/b\/a VDX.tvCookie duration: 90 (days).Data collected and processed: IP addresses, Device identifiers, Probabilistic identifiers, Browsing and interaction data, Non-precise location data, Users’ profiles, Privacy choicesmoreCookie duration resets each session.

In July, it’s about US$27 on average for a 5kg pack, prompting the government to release emergency reserves.\n\nBut the sales are massively depleting stockpiles, with only about 100,000 tonnes of rice left.\n\nJapan imports 770,000 tonnes of rice a year under WTO rules. Anything more brought in by the private sector incurs hefty tariffs of about US$2.30 per kilogram.\n\nBut as domestic rice prices soar, private sector imports are rising. In May, they amounted to some 10,600 tonnes - mostly from the United States - up from just 115 tonnes a year ago.\n\nKazuyoshi Fujimoto owns a 15-hectare rice farm in Kakogawa city - passed down for generations - but began shifting away from growing rice two years ago due to high costs.\n\n“To tend to paddy fields, you need to invest in machinery,” he said. “If it malfunctions, it costs 5 million to 6 million yen (US$33,700 to US$40,400) to replace it. So eventually, I plan to move entirely from paddy fields to growing figs.”\n\nJapan began paying farmers to reduce rice acreage in the 1970s to tackle overproduction and keep rice prices high.\n\nNow, production targets are still set by the government and influenced by Japan Agricultural Cooperatives (JA) which nearly all farmers belong to.\n\nAround 70 per cent of crops harvested are sold through JA, according to experts, and the rest to wholesalers, retailers or straight to consumers.\n\nIt sent Fujimoto a flyer offering to buy his rice for at least 11,500 yen (US$77.50) for every 30kg this year, which is about twice as much as last year.\n\n“Until three years ago, prices (paid by JA) were stable,” said Fujimoto. “But in the past year or two, prices rose a little, by 30 per cent. Then this year, it was a big hike.\"\n\nRice production has tumbled over the years, from a peak of 14.45 million tonnes in 1967 to less than 7 million tonnes last year.\n\nFarmers told CNA they were puzzled by the sudden severe shortage, with some pointing to the complexity of the supply chain.\n\nIn Nagano, known for its mountainous terrain and high-quality rice, some farmers said middlemen are paying three times more for their rice compared to last year.\n\nPoor harvests caused by heatwaves and a spike in inbound tourism are being cited as factors for the shortage. Japan's farming population, too, is steadily shrinking.\n\nAnalysts said it is critical to stop reducing rice acreage and consolidate small-scale farms by encouraging their owners - who are mostly elderly - to lease their land to larger operations.\n\n“Full-time farmers will be richer by accumulating more land. They could improve the efficiency of rice production,” said Kazuhito Yamashita, research director at the think tank Canon Institute for Global Studies.\n\n“But it is not easy to implement in Japanese politics because we have to face politically powerful agricultural cooperatives.”","summary":"What is causing this stark divide in rice supply, and is there a way to restore balance?","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/east-asia\/japan-rice-shortage-south-korea-oversupply-farm-5243036","image":"https:\/\/dam.mediacorp.sg\/image\/upload\/s--Y70uvyC2--\/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1\/f_auto,q_auto\/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600\/v1\/one-cms\/core\/2025-06-10t020922z_1_lynxmpel5901z_rtroptp_3_japan-rice.jpg?itok=S0q1mJe","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 09:14:42","author":"Lim Yun Suk","language":"en","category":null,"source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.095,"authors":["Lim Yun Suk"]},{"id":343692442,"title":"Oil prices edge down on expected minimal sanctions impact","text":"LONDON :Oil prices dipped slightly on Monday, with the latest European sanctions on Russian oil expected to have minimal impact on supplies while U.S. tariffs ensure demand concerns remain.\n\nBrent crude futures dropped 38 cents, or 0.55 per cent, to $68.90 a barrel by 0925 GMT after settling 0.35 per cent down on Friday.

It said that SharePoint Online in Microsoft 365, which is in the cloud, was not hit by the exploit, also known as a \"zero day\" because it was previously unknown to cybersecurity researchers.\n\n\"Based on the consistency of the tradecraft seen across observed attacks, the campaign launched on Friday appears to be a single actor. However, it's possible that this will quickly change,\" Rafe Pilling, Director of Threat Intelligence at Sophos, a British cybersecurity firm.\n\nThat tradecraft included the sending of the same digital payload to multiple targets, Pilling added.\n\nMicrosoft said it had \"provided security updates and encourages customers to install them,\" a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement.\n\nIt was not clear who was behind the ongoing hack. The FBI said on Sunday it was aware of the attacks and was working closely with its federal and private-sector partners, but offered no other details. Britain's National Cyber Security Centre did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Washington Post said unidentified actors in the past few days had exploited a flaw to launch an attack that targeted U.S. and international agencies and businesses.\n\nAccording to data from Shodan, a search engine that helps to identify internet-linked equipment, over 8,000 servers online could theoretically have already been compromised by hackers.\n\nThose servers include major industrial firms, banks, auditors, healthcare companies, and several U.S. state-level and international government entities.\n\n\"The SharePoint incident appears to have created a broad level of compromise across a range of servers globally,\" said Daniel Card of British cybersecurity consultancy, PwnDefend. \n\n\"Taking an assumed breach approach is wise, and it’s also important to understand that just applying the patch isn’t all that is required here.\"","summary":"","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/business\/microsoft-server-hack-likely-single-actor-thousands-firms-now-vulnerable-researchers-say-5249881","image":"https:\/\/dam.mediacorp.sg\/image\/upload\/s--dU-KVf-V--\/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1\/f_auto,q_auto\/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600\/v1\/one-cms\/core\/2025-07-21t132801z_1_lynxmpel6k0p1_rtroptp_3_tech-conference-mwc.jpg?ito","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 13:28:01","author":null,"language":"en","category":null,"source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.34,"authors":null},{"id":343780624,"title":"Crypto custody startup BitGo confidentially files for US IPO","text":"BitGo, a provider of trust and security services for digital assets, said on Monday it has confidentially filed for a U.S. listing, as crypto firms race to capitalize on renewed market momentum.\n\nSeveral high-profile companies, including those in riskier sectors like crypto and fintech, have launched successful listings in recent weeks, signaling pent-up demand and a rebound in capital markets activity.\n\nBitGo's announcement follows the crypto sector's market value hitting $4 trillion last week, driven by a wave of corporate treasury adoption, regulatory clarity in key markets, and rising institutional inflows.\n\nLast week, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a law to create a regulatory regime for dollar-pegged cryptocurrencies called stablecoins, potentially allowing the digital assets to become an everyday way to make payments and move money.\n\nBitcoin, the world's largest and best-known cryptocurrency, recently breached the $120,000 mark. It is up 26 per cent so far in 2025, while ether, the second-largest, has gained about 14 per cent.\n\nThe sector's rapid ascent has opened the floodgates for IPO filings. Crypto-focused asset manager Grayscale and Gemini, the digital assets exchange founded by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, have also confidentially filed to go public in recent weeks.\n\nThe number of shares to be offered and the price range for the proposed initial public offering have not yet been determined, BitGo said. \n\nThe Palo Alto, California-based company had raised $100 million at a $1.75 billion valuation in August 2023. \n\nFounded in 2013, BitGo is one of the largest crypto custody firms based in the U.S. These companies store and protect digital assets on behalf of clients, a role that has become increasingly important as institutional interest in crypto rises. \n\nFirms like BitGo have become key players by offering secure storage, helping clients meet regulatory requirements, and safeguarding assets against theft or loss.","summary":"","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/business\/crypto-custody-startup-bitgo-confidentially-files-us-ipo-5249871","image":"https:\/\/dam.mediacorp.sg\/image\/upload\/s--su15O6gq--\/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1\/f_auto,q_auto\/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600\/v1\/one-cms\/core\/2025-07-21t132429z_1_lynxmpel6k0ot_rtroptp_3_fintech-cryptocurrency.jpg?","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 13:17:44","author":null,"language":"en","category":null,"source_country":"sg","sentiment":0.144,"authors":null},{"id":343780620,"title":"Heated exchanges at Lord's were fun, says England's Brook","text":"England batsman Harry Brook said the tension with Indian players during the third test at Lord's was fun and put the visitors under added pressure as England secured a dramatic 22-run victory and a 2-1 lead in the series.\n\nTension flared between the teams during the match, with India captain Shubman Gill sarcastically clapping England batters over delays, and Indian fast bowler Mohammed Siraj roaring in the face of England opener Ben Duckett after taking his wicket.\n\nBrook said England decided to respond in kind after the visitors' heated verbal exchanges with Duckett and Zak Crawley when England faced a single over from Jasprit Bumrah at the end of the third day.\n\n\"We had a little chat and we thought, we're a team so we may as well get together and give it back at them,\" Brook told reporters on Monday.\n\n\"It put them under a little bit more pressure.\"\n\n\"I've had a lot of compliments.

Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting an increase of 13,000 subscribers.\n\nTo drive growth, Verizon and its rivals have been bulking up on fiber-optic assets that can tap growing consumer data use.\n\nVerizon in May won approval from the U.S. telecom regulator for its $20 billion acquisition of fiber-optic internet provider Frontier, after it agreed to end its diversity programs.\n\nThe sharper focus on internet services helped it posted 293,000 broadband net additions in the second quarter. \n\nOverall, Verizon reported revenue of $34.5 billion, beating estimates of $33.74 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Its adjusted earnings per share of $1.22 also beat estimates.","summary":"","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/business\/verizon-boosts-annual-forecast-demand-premium-plans-tax-law-benefit-5249626","image":"https:\/\/dam.mediacorp.sg\/image\/upload\/s--kO2RH6cj--\/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1\/f_auto,q_auto\/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600\/v1\/one-cms\/core\/2025-07-21t111227z_1_lynxmpel6k0j6_rtroptp_3_usa-stocks.jpg?itok=pT1dMYx","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 10:58:31","author":null,"language":"en","category":null,"source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.028,"authors":null},{"id":343780618,"title":"US passenger jet has close call with B-52 bomber","text":"WASHINGTON: A passenger jet performed an \"aggressive manoeuvre\" to avoid a mid-air collision with a US military bomber over the state of North Dakota, according to recorded audio of the commercial pilot.\n\nDelta Flight 3788, operated by SkyWest, took off from Minneapolis and was approaching the city of Minot when the pilot rapidly rerouted after seeing another aircraft nearing from the right.\n\n\"I don't know how fast they were going, but they were a lot faster than us, I felt it was the safest thing to do to turn behind it,\" the pilot told passengers.\n\n\"Sorry about the aggressive manoeuvre. It caught me by surprise, this is not normal at all.\"\n\nSkyWest was investigating the Friday incident. The flight was cleared for approach by the tower \"but performed a go-around when another aircraft became visible in their flight path\", the carrier said in a statement reported by US media.\n\nThe US Air Force did not provide specifics about the near miss but confirmed in a statement reported by the Washington Post that a B-52 bomber was performing a flyover at the North Dakota State Fair, which occurred in Minot.\n\nThe northern city, about 80km from the Canada border, is home to a commercial airport and a US Air Force base.\n\nIn the video, posted to Instagram and verified by Storyful, the SkyWest pilot told passengers that \"nobody told us\" about the other plane.\n\nHe said the Minot tower, which does not use radar - a common situation in smaller, more remote airfields in the United States - offered guidance that could have put the passenger jet in jeopardy.\n\n\"He said 'Turn right.' I said there's an airplane over there. And he says 'Turn left,'\" the pilot said according to the video.\n\nThe incident comes less than six months after a US Army helicopter collided with an American Airlines jet approaching Washington's Reagan National Airport, killing all 67 people aboard both aircraft.\n\nThe disaster prompted federal authorities and Congress to review coordination between military and civilian aircraft flying in the same airspace.","summary":"","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/world\/us-passenger-jet-has-close-call-b-52-bomber-5249991","image":"https:\/\/dam.mediacorp.sg\/image\/upload\/s--eLz0tCh_--\/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2023-11:afp_watermark_14112023,w_0.1\/f_auto,q_auto\/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600\/v1\/mediacorp\/cna\/image\/2025\/07\/21\/000_32gx3k8.jpg?itok=5DKjJcQq","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 14:18:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":null,"source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.576,"authors":null},{"id":343692448,"title":"Musk's X denies French allegations of fraudulent data extraction, algorithm abuse","text":"TCF vendors\n\nExponential Interactive, Inc d\/b\/a VDX.tvCookie duration: 90 (days).Data collected and processed: IP addresses, Device identifiers, Probabilistic identifiers, Browsing and interaction data, Non-precise location data, Users’ profiles, Privacy choicesmoreCookie duration resets each session.

But more than that, it's the hunger for the jersey. \n\n\"It'll be awesome, I'm Melbourne born and bred, I'll have all my family there and to play in front of them will be awesome.\"\n\nValetini dismissed the idea that Australia's lack of physicality in the first half in Brisbane means he will be carrying a huge weight on his shoulders on Saturday. \n\n\"I don't really feel pressure or anything like that,\" he said. \n\n\"I feel like it's just another game of rugby, something I've been playing since I was young. I just want to go out there and do my job. Whether it's carrying or tackling, I just want to do my bit for the team.\"\n\nLions coach Andy Farrell credited his powerful back row of Jack Conan, Tom Curry and Tadhg Beirne with putting the tourists firmly on the front foot in Brisbane, and Valetini said he was looking forward to getting amongst them. \n\n\"I was watching on the sidelines and all three were pretty involved, big boys and they did their jobs well,\" he said. \n\n\"I was eager to get on the field, but couldn't. But yeah, that's the challenge for us this week, knowing what's coming and being prepared for it.\"\n\nThere will also be a reunion for Valetini at the MCG when he comes up against another Melbourne-born player in Scotland centre Sione Tuipulotu. \n\n\"I played through all my grades growing up with Sione, he was the guy you wanted to be in rugby in Melbourne ... and I was pretty shocked when he had to leave (Australia),\" Valetini said. \n\n\"It's been a wild journey for him to be able to come back here and play for the Lions against us. It'll be pretty cool to play against him and I'll probably try and get one up on him.\" \n\nProp James Slipper, who played in the second-test victory over the Lions in Melbourne which levelled up the 2013 series, said he was delighted to have Valetini back on board. \n\n\"His size definitely helps,\" the 36-year-old grinned. \"Nah, Bobby's a really good player, he gives a lot of boys around him a lot of confidence just the way he goes about his business.\"","summary":"","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/sport\/hometown-boy-valetini-hungry-lions-after-enforced-absence-5249151","image":"https:\/\/dam.mediacorp.sg\/image\/upload\/s--NfmabRwY--\/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1\/f_auto,q_auto\/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600\/v1\/one-cms\/core\/2025-07-21t064521z_1_lynxmpel6k06w_rtroptp_3_rugby-union-lions-valetini.","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 06:45:21","author":null,"language":"en","category":null,"source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.052,"authors":null},{"id":343635280,"title":"Alaska Airlines resumes operations after IT outage","text":"U.S. carrier Alaska Airlines resumed operations late on Sunday after briefly grounding all of its flights for about three hours due to an IT outage, marking the second time it has halted its fleet in just over a year. \n\nThe company requested a system-wide ground stop for Alaska and Horizon Air flights at around 8 p.m. Pacific on Sunday (0300 GMT on Monday) after it said that an outage impacted its systems, and lifted the ground stop by 11 p.m. Pacific, the carrier said. \n\n\"As we reposition our aircraft and crews, there will most likely be residual impacts to our flights.

Alaska Air Group said it was still determining the financial impact of that event. \n\nThe news of Alaska's IT issues comes at a time when tech companies Google and Palo Alto Networks have warned of the \"Scattered Spider\" hacking group's interest in the aviation sector.\n\nCanada's WestJet Airlines was struck by an unspecified cyber incident in June, while Australia's Qantas experienced a data breach in July where a cyber hacker accessed the personal information of millions of customers.

Figma is expected to start trading close on the heels of stablecoin giant Circle, which debuted with eye-popping gains last month and has continued surging since. \n\nAs a major technology player that appears supportive of bitcoin, Figma has already drawn attention on social media.\n\nThe company had around $70 million invested in Bitwise's bitcoin exchange-traded fund as of March 31 and intends to allocate a further $30 million to bitcoin, its filing showed.\n\nFigma expects to list under the symbol \"FIG\". Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Allen & Co and J.P. Morgan are among the underwriters for the offering.\n\nIt was valued at $12.5 billion in a tender offer last year that allowed employees and early investors to cash out a portion of their stake.\n\n'BIG SWINGS'\n\nFigma is a cloud-based design platform that allows users to collaboratively create and edit apps, websites and software interfaces.\n\nIts customers include ServiceNow, Workday and SAP. Its revenue rose 46 per cent in the first three months of 2025, while net income jumped three-fold.\n\n\"Figma's product is its primary marketing engine.

Spirulina is a blue-green algae, famous for its protein-richness and abundance of essential amino acids. It is also packed with B vitamins, iron, magnesium, and antioxidants like phycocyanin (which gives it a bright color). Spirulina comes in powder or tablet form making it easy to incorporate into smoothies or juices for an instant energy boost during the day.

Corcoran had initially purchased a multi-draw Powerball ticket for seven games. However, thinking the last drawing had already happened, he bought another seven-draw ticket from a different store just minutes later. This simple mistake turned into his fortune as both tickets matched all five white balls drawn on July 9. The winning tickets were bought from a Market Basket supermart in Fitchburg, and a Country Farms convenience store in Leominster. Both shops will receive a $10,000 bonus for selling the $1 million winning ticket. These are also the first Powerball tickets worth $1 million that have been sold in Fitchburg and Leominster.

The San Francisco-based firm and its investors plan to raise as much as $1.03 billion by selling nearly 37 million shares at an estimated price range of $25-$28 per share. The upcoming IPO marks a major milestone for Figma, especially after its $20 billion sale to Adobe was called off more than a year ago due to regulatory issues in Europe and the UK. The company plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FIG. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Allen & Co., and JP Morgan will be underwriting this offering. Figma's revenue surged 46% in Q1 2025, while its net income tripled. The company serves a broad range of clients, including ServiceNow, Workday, and SAP. Despite its impressive growth, Figma has hinted at potential big swings with mergers and acquisitions (M&A). Co-founder and CEO Dylan Field said they are ready to make decisions that may not seem immediately rational. As a major tech player that seems to back Bitcoin, Figma has already caught the eye on social media. The company had invested some $70 million in Bitwise's Bitcoin exchange-traded fund as of March 31 and plans to invest another $30 million into Bitcoin. This move comes as investors have been eagerly awaiting new share sales amid an equities rally and strong debuts recently.","summary":"Figma, a leading cloud-based design software company, is gearing up for an initial public offering (IPO) in the US.","url":"https:\/\/www.newsbytesapp.com\/news\/business\/figma-targets-13-65b-valuation-in-ipo-aims-to-raise-1-03b\/story","image":"https:\/\/i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com\/images\/l51020250721192858.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 19:26:25","author":"Akash Pandey","language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.143,"authors":["Akash Pandey"]},{"id":343865938,"title":"'Serving in this transformative era…true honor': Jagdeep Dhankhar in resignation letter","text":"Vice President of India Jagdeep Dhankhar has resigned from his post, citing health reasons.

This dish, primarily made from lentils and tempered with spices, showcases the diversity and adaptability of Indian culinary practices. Each region has its unique take on dal tadka, reflecting local tastes and ingredients. Understanding its journey offers insights into how regional influences have shaped this beloved dish over time. In North India, dal tadka is usually made with yellow lentils such as toor or moong dal. The tempering consists of cumin seeds, garlic, and ghee for a rich flavor profile. This variant is commonly served with rice or roti and is popular for its comforting taste. The addition of ghee makes for a distinct aroma which is typical of North Indian cuisine. Western India adds its own twist to dal tadka by adding ingredients such as mustard seeds and curry leaves in the tempering process. In states like Gujarat and Maharashtra, the dish may even be prepared with jaggery to add a hint of sweetness to it. This variation highlights the sweet and savory flavor balance that is common in Western Indian cooking. In South India, dal tadka usually has red lentils or masoor dal as the main ingredient. The tempering has mustard seeds, dried red chilies, and coconut oil for an added layer of flavor. This version can also be spicier than the others due to the generous use of chilies in South Indian cuisine. Eastern regions like Bengal has its own take on dal tadka where panch phoron—a mix of five spices—are used for tempering. Lentils such as moong or masoor are used here as well.

Knowing the truth behind these myths is important to reap the maximum benefits from your exercise routine. This article will debunk common misconceptions about fitness machines, helping you improve your workouts. By making fact-based choices, you can further boost your fitness journey. A common misconception is that sweating more during a workout signifies burning more calories or achieving better results. However, sweat is essentially a method of regulating body temperature and not a measure of workout intensity or calories burnt. Things like room temperature, humidity, and your own physiology determine sweat levels. Instead of relying solely on sweat, focus on heart rate and perceived exertion as better measures of workout intensity. Many think free weights are better than machines for building strength and muscle mass. While free weights are versatile and engage stabilizing muscles, machines offer controlled movements that can benefit beginners or those recovering from injuries. Machines allow users to focus on specific muscle groups without worrying about balance or form errors, making them an effective tool in a balanced fitness regimen. The notion that using certain machines can spot-target fat loss is a long-standing myth. Spot reduction isn't possible; fat loss happens all over the body depending on genetics and overall caloric expenditure. Machines can only help tone muscles in targeted areas but can't spot-reduce fat there. A mix of cardiovascular exercise, strength training, and proper nutrition is key to overall fat loss. The idea that longer workouts automatically mean better results ignores the fact that quality beats quantity when it comes to workouts. Shorter sessions with greater intensity or variation of exercises can be as effective as longer ones if they push the body the right way. Adding interval training or circuit workouts to your routine may make it more efficient without lengthening workout time unnecessarily. Cardio machines aren't just for shedding those extra pounds; they also boost your cardiovascular health. By using them regularly, you strengthen your heart and improve your lung capacity through aerobic activity. This benefit comes regardless of your weight goals, easily fitting into your routine depending on your needs and preferences. It yields better wellness outcomes if you put in consistent effort in each session.","summary":"Fitness machines are often shrouded in myths, which can mislead users and hamper the effectiveness of their workout.","url":"https:\/\/www.newsbytesapp.com\/news\/lifestyle\/unravel-fitness-machine-myths-today\/story","image":"https:\/\/i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com\/images\/l24220250721172006.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 18:20:54","author":"Simran Jeet","language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":0.326,"authors":["Simran Jeet"]},{"id":343865928,"title":"Why puzzles are the best games for your kids","text":"Puzzle-solving activities aren't just a fun pastime for kids. They are also an important component of the development of several emotional skills that are critical for their growth. Solving puzzles not only improves kids' cognitive skills but also builds emotional intelligence. These activities promote the development of patience, perseverance, problem-solving skills, etc., which are critical to overcoming life's challenges. Here are five emotional skills kids can develop through puzzle-solving activities. Puzzle-solving takes time and effort which teaches children the importance of patience and persistence. As they work their way through complex problems, kids learn to remain calm and focused even when faced with difficulties. This skill proves to be invaluable as it enables them to understand that not all solutions come instantly and that perseverance is the key to overcoming obstacles. Engaging with puzzles also boosts children's problem-solving skills by prompting them to think critically and creatively. As they piece together different pieces or scenarios, they learn to spot patterns and develop strategies to come up with solutions. This skill comes into play during real-life situations where critical thinking is required to make informed decisions. The joy of successfully completing a puzzle gives children a sense of accomplishment, which helps in boosting their self-esteem. Each solved puzzle strengthens their belief in their own capabilities, pushing them to take up more challenging tasks in the future. This added confidence can also affect other areas of their lives positively. The other way puzzle-solving helps kids is that it teaches them emotional regulation. Children learn how to handle frustration when things don't go their way. As they face setbacks\/make mistakes in the process, they know how to deal with these emotions constructively instead of giving up or getting too upset. Puzzles need sustained attention for long periods, enabling kids to enhance their focus and concentration levels considerably over time. As kids engage deeply in these activities without distractions around them constantly pulling away attention spans elsewhere—children cultivate an ability crucially needed across various aspects throughout life's journey ahead!","summary":"Puzzle-solving activities aren't just a fun pastime for kids.","url":"https:\/\/www.newsbytesapp.com\/news\/lifestyle\/five-emotional-skills-kids-develop-through-puzzle-solving\/story","image":"https:\/\/i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com\/images\/l22220250721191520.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 19:15:33","author":"Anujj Trehaan","language":"en","category":null,"source_country":"sg","sentiment":0.505,"authors":["Anujj Trehaan"]},{"id":343865924,"title":"Notable records of Novak Djokovic at Masters 1000 events","text":"Serbian ace Novak Djokovic recently announced that he will miss the impending Canada Masters, starting July 27.

Founded by former supermarket manager Sohei Kamiya on YouTube during the coronavirus pandemic, Sanseito has now won 14 seats in the upper house of parliament. Per CNN, the party's Japanese First campaign resonated with voters who were unhappy with issues like overtourism and the influx of foreign residents. The party's rise is particularly significant, as Japan has seen a surge in foreign residents from 2.23 million to 3.77 million over the past decade; foreigners only make up 3% of Japan's population. Tourist numbers also continue to rise, but this has led to difficulties in towns overrun with visitors, some of whom act inappropriately, and depletion of resources like the country's famous hot springs. Sanseito capitalized on this public discontent along with stagnant wages, high inflation, and living costs with its Japanese First platform. Right now, Japanese people's lives are getting harder and harder, Kamiya said in his speech back in July. More and more foreigners are coming (to Japan), he warned. He went on to say that while he didn't hate tourists, relying on cheap immigrant labor would undermine Japanese wages and that foreign workers who couldn't find work would increase crime. The party favors limiting the number of foreign inhabitants in each town or city, tightening immigration and benefits for foreigners, and making it more difficult to naturalize as citizens. Sanseito is also advocating for tighter security and anti-espionage regulations, higher tax cuts, renewable energy, and a health-care system that is less reliant on vaccines. It has advocated for increased military capabilities, warning that Japan is surrounded by nuclear-armed countries and hence needs a deterrent force while working toward long-term denuclearization. Kamiya has drawn comparisons between Sanseito and other right-wing populist movements, such as Donald Trump's MAGA movement in the United States. Many have condemned Sanseito's platform as xenophobic and bigoted. According to Reuters, he tried to tone down some of the party's more contentious views before the election in order to win more female votes. However, after the election results were announced, he said, The public came to understand that the media was wrong and Sanseito was right. The election results have put Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba under pressure as his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lost its majority in both houses of parliament. The LDP's loss is a major setback for the long-ruling party, which had maintained power for 15 years until recently.

As per latest reports, seamer Akash Deep also picked up a groin niggle ahead of the 4th Test. Speaking ahead of the Manchester Test, Siraj addressed the injury concerns of Akash Deep. He said Deep bowled today and will be checked by the physios. Despite these concerns, Siraj was confident about Bumrah's participation in the match, saying Jassi bhai toh khelege (Bumrah will definitely play). As has been the case, India's final Playing XI will be announced at the toss on July 23. Bumrah returned to India's Test XI for the Lord's Test after missing out at Edgbaston. Although India lost at Lord's, he registered a historic first-innings fifer. He recorded his 13th Test fifer away from home, breaking Kapil Dev's record of 12. Bumrah set several records with his fifer in the series opener at Headingley as well. However, India lost despite defending 370. India's squad: Shubman Gill (captain), Rishabh Pant (vice-captain and wicket-keeper), Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Karun Nair, Ravindra Jadeja, Dhruv Jurel (wicket-keeper), Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep, Kuldeep Yadav, and Anshul Kamboj.","summary":"In a boost for the Team India, Mohammed Siraj has confirmed Jasprit Bumrah's availability for the impending 4th Test against England at Old Trafford, Manchester.","url":"https:\/\/www.newsbytesapp.com\/news\/sports\/jasprit-bumrah-set-to-play-4th-test-against-england\/story","image":"https:\/\/i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com\/images\/l98820250721183413.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 18:39:49","author":"Parth Dhall","language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.135,"authors":["Parth Dhall"]},{"id":343865916,"title":"India's core sector growth inches up to 1.7% in June","text":"India's core sector output, which comprises eight key industries, grew by 1.7% in June. The data was released by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry on Monday. This is a slight improvement over May's revised growth rate of 1.2%. However, it is significantly lower than the impressive 5% growth recorded in June last year. The core sector output is a composite of coal, crude oil, natural gas, refinery products, fertilizers, steel, cement, and electricity. In June, five out of these eight sectors, coal (6.8%), crude oil (1.2%), natural gas (2.8%), fertilizers (1.2%), and electricity generation (2.8%), witnessed a decline in their respective outputs year-on-year (YoY). This dip highlights the challenges faced by these key industries during this period. Despite the overall slowdown, three sectors, refinery products (3.4%), steel (9.3%), and cement (9.2%), registered positive growth in June. This indicates that while some industries are struggling, others are managing to maintain their momentum and contribute positively to the core sector output. The data for April-June this fiscal year shows an expansion of 1.3% against a much higher 6.2% during the same period last fiscal year. The core sector output contributes 40.27% to the Index of Industrial Production (IIP). This highlights its significance in determining India's industrial performance.

Just a few minutes of these practices each day can help you clear your mind and lower your stress levels. These exercises are simple and effective, which means anyone can practice them to have a more focused mind. Here are five mindful breathing techniques that could help you improve focus in your everyday life. Deep belly breathing means taking deep inhales through the nose and letting the diaphragm expand fully. This technique not only increases the amount of oxygen you take in, but also helps you relax by activating your body's parasympathetic nervous system. Just five minutes of practicing deep belly breathing can make a world of a difference in your concentration and mental clarity. Box breathing is a structured technique that includes four equal parts: inhale, hold, exhale, and hold again. Each part is of four seconds. This technique ensures that you regulate your breath pattern and calm your mind. It makes it easy to focus on tasks requiring sustained attention. Alternate nostril breathing is where you close one nostril, inhale through the other, and switch for exhalation. It balances the brain's hemispheres, promoting mental stability and better focus. With regular practice, this technique not only improves concentration but also reduces anxiety levels, making it an effective addition to the daily mindfulness practice. The 4-7-8 method includes inhaling for four seconds, holding breath for seven seconds, and exhaling slowly over eight seconds. The exercise slows down heart rate, and promotes relaxation by temporarily increasing carbon dioxide levels in the blood. It's especially useful before starting activities that require intense concentration. In this exercise, you count your breaths up to ten and start again from one. The idea is to keep track of every single breath without losing count or getting distracted by other thoughts or stimuli around you. This improves your overall mindfulness skills. It takes you towards better focus abilities over time when practiced regularly. It should be a part of your daily routine.","summary":"Mindful breathing exercises can do wonders for your focus and concentration.","url":"https:\/\/www.newsbytesapp.com\/news\/lifestyle\/cultivate-focus-with-mindful-breathing\/story","image":"https:\/\/i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com\/images\/l71420250721171724.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 18:20:31","author":"Simran Jeet","language":"en","category":null,"source_country":"sg","sentiment":0.477,"authors":["Simran Jeet"]},{"id":343865904,"title":"Most peaceful beaches in Eastern Europe: A list","text":"If you're looking for some tranquil spots to go on a vacation, Eastern Europe is home to a treasure trove of hidden beaches.

Not only does this extend the life of old garments, it also adds warmth and style to any outfit. Fabric scraps from other projects can easily be turned into one-of-a-kind jewelry pieces, like necklaces or bracelets. Use strips of fabric to create braided designs, or wrap them around existing jewelry bases for a touch of flair. This technique can be explored endlessly when it comes to color combinations and styles, helping you express your creativity while minimizing fabric waste. Old denim jeans can be upcycled into fashionable headbands with a lot of ease. Simply cut strips of denim fabric, fold them lengthwise, and sew along the edges for durability.

The United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) reported that nearly 90% of schools in the region have been destroyed and will require extensive rebuilding. The war began in October 2023 after Hamas's attack on October 7, triggering Israel's retaliatory campaign that has continued since. The war has displaced many families, including 18-year-old Sarah Qanan's. Her family now lives in a tent after their home was destroyed by an Israeli airstrike in early 2024. My sole dream was to study medicine, Qanan told AP, adding that she has now given up on her dreams of becoming a doctor and is focused on survival instead. The war has also disrupted the education system in Gaza. Schools have been closed since October 2023, with many turning into overcrowded shelters for those fleeing their homes. Younger children are missing out on basic skills like reading and arithmetic, while older students have had their advanced subjects and college applications put on hold. Local education officials and UNICEF have set up hundreds of learning spaces to salvage some educational activities during the war. A six-week ceasefire in January and February allowed around 173,000 children to attend classes in these makeshift spaces. However, since the end of the March truce, nearly half of them have closed down due to continued hostilities. Some students have tried to continue their studies through online learning, but the lack of central electricity and unreliable internet access in Gaza make this difficult. Ola Shaban, a civil engineering student, had to abandon her studies due to these challenges. I couldn't continue because of lack of internet, continuous displacement, and the constant sense of fear, she said. The Gaza Health Ministry reported that over 57,000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict. The ministry, part of Hamas's government, does not distinguish between combatants and civilians but claims that over half of the dead are women and children. Hamas militants killed around 1,200 people in their October 7 attack and abducted 251.

Once a simple rice and lentil pancake, the dosa is now a versatile dish, celebrated all over the globe. Here's how the dosa went from being a humble street food to an imperative part of fine dining experiences globally. The dosa's journey perfectly mirrors trends in culinary innovation and globalization. Dosa's history spans over a millennium, with its origin tracing back to ancient Tamil Nadu. Once an everyday breakfast item for locals, dosa was prepared with simple ingredients like rice and urad dal. Gradually, regional variations developed across India, each contributing distinctive tastes and textures. As trade routes opened up in medieval times, dosa started to spread beyond its birthplace. With globalization came the fusion of cuisines from different cultures. The dosa made its way into international kitchens where chefs experimented with fillings and accompaniments. Today's dosas can be stuffed with everything from cheese to vegetables or even sweet fillings like chocolate spread for dessert versions. This adaptability has helped cement its place on menus around the world. In the past few years, dosas have entered the domain of upscale restaurants, where they are being revamped into gourmet spreads. Chefs are adding elements of the exotic, like truffles or saffron, while keeping the traditional chutneys or sambhar on the side. These innovations have taken dosas from the streets to haute cuisine that pleases the discerning palates. The trend of health-conscious eating habits has also contributed to dosa's growing popularity owing to its nutritional benefits—being gluten-free when made the traditional way—and high protein content from the lentils used in the batter preparation process. Many health-conscious individuals appreciate this, as well as the fact that they are customizable with different toppings or fillings served at eateries these days.","summary":"The humble dosa—a South Indian staple—has transformed in the most interesting of ways over the years.","url":"https:\/\/www.newsbytesapp.com\/news\/lifestyle\/tracing-dosas-evolution-from-humble-to-haute\/story","image":"https:\/\/i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com\/images\/l13320250721191324.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 19:13:36","author":"Anujj Trehaan","language":"en","category":null,"source_country":"sg","sentiment":0.806,"authors":["Anujj Trehaan"]},{"id":343865888,"title":"No family visitations, no friends: Sonam Raghuvanshi's prison life","text":"Sonam Raghuvanshi, accused of murdering her husband, Raja Raghuvanshi, during their honeymoon, has spent a month in Shillong jail.

Although not given any special tasks yet, NDTV sources say she will be taught sewing as part of skill development work. Meanwhile, Raja's brother Vipin Raghuvanshi has alleged that Sonam's family has spoken to her four times since her arrest. He accused Sonam's brother Govind of pretending to be sympathetic while helping his sister. Vipin claimed, I believe Sonam and Govind have been talking for the past four weeks. The entire family is in on it. They've hired a lawyer and are actively trying for bail. Govind had previously condemned Sonam's actions and supported Raja's family in their quest for justice. He said earlier, If she is found guilty, she should be given the death penalty. The families had last come together during Raja's last rites, where Govind was seen standing alongside the victim's family. I have come with Raja's family to perform his last rites... they are like my brother's family, he said at the time. Raja Raghuvanshi, an Indore-based businessman, wed Sonam on May 11. The pair left for their honeymoon trip to Guwahati and Shillong on May 20, but were reported missing three days later. Raja's body was discovered on June 2 in a steep valley in the Sohra area of the East Khasi Hills in Meghalaya. Sonam later surrendered in Ghazipur, Uttar Pradesh. She and four other accused—alleged lover Raj Kushwaha, Akash Rajput, Vishal Singh Chauhan, and Anand Kurmi—were arrested for the murder.","summary":"Sonam Raghuvanshi, accused of murdering her husband, Raja Raghuvanshi, during their honeymoon, has spent a month in Shillong jail.","url":"https:\/\/www.newsbytesapp.com\/news\/india\/no-family-members-have-visited-sonam-raghuvanshi-in-jail\/story","image":"https:\/\/i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com\/images\/l290_3791753104594.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 19:00:15","author":"Chanshimla Varah","language":"en","category":null,"source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.181,"authors":["Chanshimla Varah"]},{"id":343865890,"title":"5 must-have edible flowers","text":"Edible flowers have been a part of culinary traditions for centuries, giving unique flavors and vibrant colors to dishes. For those mastering vegetarian cooking, adding edible flowers can take the dining experience to a whole new level. These beauties not only amp the visual appeal of a dish but also add their own taste and nutrition. Here are five must-have edible flowers to make your vegetarian kitchen a haven of creativity and flavors. Nasturtiums are famous for their bright colors and peppery taste, making them a common pick in salads and garnishes. Both the leaves and flowers can be consumed, giving a slightly spicy kick similar to watercress. They are high in vitamin C, which promotes immune health. Nasturtiums can be used fresh or pickled, adding versatility to dishes ranging from appetizers to main courses. Calendula petals provide a saffron-like hue to dishes, without the exorbitant price of saffron itself. Nicknamed poor man's saffron, calendula has a mild, peppery taste that goes well with soups, stews, and rice dishes. It is also famed for its anti-inflammatory properties, owing to its high flavonoid content. Calendula can be used fresh or dried, making it a versatile ingredient in any kitchen. Popularly known for its cucumber-like taste, Borage adds freshness to salads and drinks alike. The star-shaped blue flowers are stunning to look at and provide a cooling effect when put into summer drinks or cool soups. Rich in gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), an omega-6 fatty acid good for skin, Borage's leaves can be cooked like spinach or used raw as garnishing. Violets add a hint of sweetness and nutrients like vitamins A and C to desserts or salads. Their soft purple flowers make them perfect for garnishing cakes or giving syrups a floral flavor. Traditionally, violets have also been used in herbal remedies for their soothing effect on respiratory diseases like cough and cold. Pansies are available in a range of colors, from deep purples to bright yellows. They provide a mild, grassy flavor that is appropriate across cuisines, including Asian-inspired dishes where subtlety is key. Rich antioxidants found in these blossoms help fight oxidative stress. This improves overall wellness when consumed regularly, be it raw on top of leafy greens or stir-fried with tofu-based entrees.","summary":"Edible flowers have been a part of culinary traditions for centuries, giving unique flavors and vibrant colors to dishes.","url":"https:\/\/www.newsbytesapp.com\/news\/lifestyle\/five-essential-edible-flowers-for-vegetarian-kitchen-mastery\/story","image":"https:\/\/i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com\/images\/l1520250721190844.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 19:08:57","author":"Anujj Trehaan","language":"en","category":null,"source_country":"sg","sentiment":1.0,"authors":["Anujj Trehaan"]},{"id":343865886,"title":"This Italian gear maker is eyeing $250M IPO in India","text":"Bonfiglioli Transmissions, the Indian arm of Italian gear manufacturer Bonfiglioli Group, is considering an initial public offering (IPO) in Mumbai.

These DIY solutions are designed to promote calmness and happiness in dogs, using ingredients that are usually found at home. By incorporating these herbal methods, pet owners can help manage their dog's stress levels and enhance their overall mood. Here, we explore several easy-to-make herbal DIYs that can contribute positively to your dog's mental health. Chamomile is known for its calming properties and can be effective for anxiety-prone dogs. For a chamomile infusion, steep one tablespoon of dried chamomile flowers in hot water for about ten minutes. This infusion, once cooled, can be added to your dog's drinking water or used for the final rinse in a bath. Chamomile soothes nerves and promotes relaxation without any side effects. Lavender oil is also well known for its calming properties for both humans and animals. To prepare a lavender spray, add ten drops of lavender essential oil in a spray bottle filled with one cup of distilled water. Lightly mist your dog's bedding or favorite resting spot with this. Lavender's aroma helps lower stress levels and provides a calming atmosphere. Valerian root is another herb that is known to relieve anxiety in dogs. You can prepare valerian root treats by mixing half a teaspoon of powdered valerian root into the homemade dog treat dough before baking them as usual. These treats make for an effective way to manage anxiety symptoms naturally, while treating your dog with something tasty. Traditionally, lemon balm has been used to uplift mood and ease tension. To prepare lemon balm tea, steep one teaspoon of dried lemon balm leaves in hot water till it cools down completely. Add this tea sparingly into your dog's food or water bowl once daily. It helps enhance mood stability without causing drowsiness.","summary":"Herbal remedies can be a natural way to support your dog's well-being.","url":"https:\/\/www.newsbytesapp.com\/news\/lifestyle\/essential-herbal-diys-for-dogs-calm-and-happiness\/story","image":"https:\/\/i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com\/images\/l3220250721191801.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 19:18:27","author":"Anujj Trehaan","language":"en","category":null,"source_country":"sg","sentiment":0.3,"authors":["Anujj Trehaan"]},{"id":343586830,"title":"Japan PM hangs on after losing Upper House majority","text":"\"JAPANESE FIRST\"\n\nIn the election, 125 seats in the 248-seat Upper House were contested.\n\nThe coalition needed 50 of those up for grabs, but NHK and others said they only won 47, with the LDP winning 39 and Komeito eight, giving them 122 deputies.\n\nSecond-placed was the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDP), which won 22 of those being contested, followed by the Democratic Party For the People (DPP) with 17.\n\nThe right-wing Sanseito party won 14 seats.\n\nSanseito wants \"stricter rules and limits\" on immigration, opposes \"radical\" gender policies, and wants a rethink on decarbonisation and vaccines.\n\nLast week, it was forced to deny any links to Moscow - which has backed populist parties elsewhere - after Russian state media interviewed a candidate.\n\nThe opposition is fragmented, and chances are slim that the parties can form an alternative government.\n\nBut pressure will grow on the coalition to cut or abolish the consumption tax, something which Ishiba has opposed in view of Japan's colossal national debts of over 200 per cent of gross domestic product.\n\nAfter years of stagnant or falling prices, consumers in the world's fourth-largest economy have been squeezed by inflation since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.","summary":"","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/east-asia\/japan-pm-shigeru-ishiba-upper-house-election-5248866","image":"https:\/\/dam.mediacorp.sg\/image\/upload\/s--r57ZIrt7--\/c_crop,h_450,w_800,x_0,y_75\/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1\/f_auto,q_auto\/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600\/v1\/one-cms\/core\/2025-07-20t192333z_1_lynxmpel6j0a5_rtroptp_3","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 02:28:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":null,"source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.227,"authors":null},{"id":343597418,"title":"MSC’s boxship binge rolls on with 10 more giants ordered across China","text":"Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) has once again underlined its seemingly insatiable appetite for new tonnage, declaring and placing orders for a further 10 ultra-large container vessels, its orderbook now larger than the extant fleet of Ocean Network Express (ONE), the world’s sixth largest liner. \n\nMSC has confirmed options for two 22,000 teu LNG dual-fuel vessels at Hengli Heavy Industry in Dalian, with delivery pencilled in for 2029. \n\nIn parallel, MSC has inked a separate deal for two 21,700 teu LNG-ready containerships at Zhoushan Changhong International Shipyard, with handover also expected in 2029. \n\nThe most significant fresh move comes at China Merchants Heavy Industry (CMHI) Jiangsu, where MSC has booked three firm plus three optional 21,000 teu LNG-capable ships.

Both companies' models solved five out of six problems, achieving the result using general-purpose \"reasoning\" models that processed mathematical concepts using natural language, in contrast to the previous approaches used by AI firms. \n\nThe achievement suggests AI is less than a year away from being used by mathematicians to crack unsolved research problems at the frontier of the field, according to Junehyuk Jung, a math professor at Brown University and visiting researcher in Google's DeepMind AI unit.\n\n\"I think the moment we can solve hard reasoning problems in natural language will enable the potential for collaboration between AI and mathematicians,\" Jung told Reuters.\n\nThe same idea can apply to research quandaries in other fields such as physics, said Jung, who won an IMO gold medal as a student in 2003.\n\nOf the 630 students participating in the 66th IMO on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, Australia, 67 contestants, or about 11 per cent, achieved gold-medal scores.\n\nGoogle's DeepMind AI unit last year achieved a silver medal score using AI systems specialized for math. This year, Google used a general-purpose model called Gemini Deep Think, a version of which was previously unveiled at its annual developer conference in May.\n\nUnlike previous AI attempts that relied on formal languages and lengthy computation, Google's approach this year operated entirely in natural language and solved the problems within the official 4.5-hour time limit, the company said in a blog post.\n\nOpenAI, which has its own set of reasoning models, similarly built an experimental version for the competition, according to a post by researcher Alexander Wei on social media platform X. He noted that the company does not plan to release anything with this level of math capability for several months.\n\nThis year marked the first time the competition coordinated officially with some AI developers, who have for years used prominent math competitions like IMO to test model capabilities. IMO judges certified the results of those companies, including Google, and asked them to publish results on July 28.\n\n\"We respected the IMO Board's original request that all AI labs share their results only after the official results had been verified by independent experts and the students had rightly received the acclamation they deserved,\" Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis said on X on Monday.\n\nHowever, OpenAI, which did not work with the IMO, self-published its results on Saturday, allowing it to be first among AI firms to claim gold-medal status.\n\nIn turn, the competition on Monday allowed cooperating companies to publish results, Gregor Dolinar, president of IMO's board, told Reuters.","summary":"","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/business\/google-and-openais-ai-models-win-milestone-gold-global-math-competition-5250661","image":"https:\/\/dam.mediacorp.sg\/image\/upload\/s--VbRFU-nF--\/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1\/f_auto,q_auto\/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600\/v1\/one-cms\/core\/2025-07-21t220441z_1_lynxmpel6k10q_rtroptp_3_alphabet-results.jpg?itok=Q","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 22:04:41","author":null,"language":"en","category":null,"source_country":"sg","sentiment":0.0,"authors":null},{"id":343898704,"title":"Olympic champion Zheng withdraws from US Open after elbow surgery","text":"Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen has withdrawn from the U.S. Open as she recovers from right elbow surgery, tournament organisers announced Monday. \n\nThe world number six revealed last week on Instagram that she has been struggling with \"persistent pain\" in her right elbow, which affected her performance during both training and matches.\n\nAfter exploring various treatments with little success, Zheng decided to undergo arthroscopic surgery following consultations with elbow specialists and her support team. \n\nShe has since announced she will be taking a short break from competition to focus on her recovery.\n\nThe 22-year-old Chinese star enjoyed a remarkable run last year, capturing gold at the Paris Olympics and reaching the final of the 2024 Australian Open. \n\nHowever, her momentum was halted at Wimbledon this year, where she was eliminated in the first round by Czech player Katerina Siniakova earlier in July.\n\nWith Zheng's withdrawal, France's Leolia Jeanjean will move into the main draw of the U.S. Open, the final Grand Slam of the season, which begins with main draw action on August 24 in New York.","summary":"","url":"https:\/\/www.channelnewsasia.com\/sport\/olympic-champion-zheng-withdraws-us-open-after-elbow-surgery-5250651","image":"https:\/\/dam.mediacorp.sg\/image\/upload\/s--4bxxYIqY--\/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1\/f_auto,q_auto\/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600\/v1\/one-cms\/core\/2025-07-21t215911z_1_lynxmpel6k10o_rtroptp_3_tennis-wimbledon.jpg?itok=Y","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 21:59:11","author":null,"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"sg","sentiment":0.327,"authors":null},{"id":343898706,"title":"Activist Elliott grows stake in Equinix, holds talks with company","text":"NEW YORK :Activist investor Elliott Investment Management has a large investment in data center operator Equinix and has increased its stake in the last weeks, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday, after the company's stock price tumbled last month.\n\nThe hedge fund, which has made a string of profitable technology investments including bets on Salesforce, Texas Instruments and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, has been holding discussions with Equinix, said the person, who was not permitted to discuss the private talks publicly.

Experts predict that by 2050, AMR could be responsible for up to 40 million deaths every year. The economic impact could be staggering with healthcare costs reaching around $1.6 trillion annually. Shockingly, over 70 percent of infections caught in hospitals are now linked to these hardy bacteria.\n\nThe Southeast Asia region is especially hard-hit. Developing new antibiotics isn’t getting any easier, which leaves doctors with fewer options to fight resistant infections. To make matters worse, superbugs like Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) do not just resist existing antibiotics, they also create a thick biofilm that shields them from treatment efforts.\n\nTo tackle this problem, scientists at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), in collaboration with researchers from the University of Illinois, have come up with a novel approach.\n\nThey’ve designed a platform that utilizes tiny bubbles, known as microbubbles, to deliver gene-targeting nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are designed to break down biofilms, offering a promising new way to treat stubborn infections that resist regular antibiotics.\n\nThe researchers developed short strands of DNA aimed at interfering with three critical MRSA genes – one for biofilm formation (icaA), one for cell division (ftsZ), and one for antibiotic resistance (mecA). They packed these DNA sequences into specially made nanoparticles (BTN) that can penetrate bacteria. To get through the tough biofilm barrier, they also used microbubbles (MB), which temporarily make bacterial membranes more permeable.\n\nThe treatment works in two steps. First, the microbubbles create pressure changes that open up the biofilm. Next, the nanoparticles pass through these openings and deliver their DNA directly into the bacteria, which causes the bacteria to turn off the genes that help them grow, form biofilms, or resist antibiotics.\n\nExperiments on infected pig skin and mouse wounds showed that this combined BTN-MB treatment considerably decreased biofilm thickness, reduced bacterial counts, and eased inflammation.\n\nThese promising results point toward a new way to fight resistant MRSA infections.\n\n“This study presents a new therapeutic solution that combines nanotechnology, gene suppression, and physical delivery strategies to address superbug infections that existing antibiotics cannot resolve. We will continue our research with the aim of expanding its application to systemic infections and various other infectious diseases,” said Hyun Jung Chung, the lead researcher and associate professor at the Department of Biological Sciences, KAIST.\n\nSource: Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST); Image: Shutterstock\n\nThis study can be found at Microbubble-Controlled Delivery of Bioﬁlm-TargetingNanoparticles to Treat MRSA Infection\n\nDisclaimer: This article does not necessarily reflect the views of AsianScientist or its staff.","summary":"This new approach utilizes nanotechnology, gene suppression, and delivery strategies to combat superbug infections that antibiotics cannot treat.","url":"https:\/\/www.asianscientist.com\/2025\/07\/health\/pop-the-biofilm-treatment-for-antibiotic-resistant-superbugs\/","image":"https:\/\/www.asianscientist.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/11\/children-learning_shutterstock_1924500848-640x379.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-21 23:44:38","author":"Puja Bhattacharjee","language":"en","category":null,"source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.097,"authors":["Puja Bhattacharjee"]},{"id":344022388,"title":"Old panamax bulker gets new life as China’s offshore fish farm","text":"China has rolled out its largest ocean-going aquaculture vessel to date, completing the conversion of a panamax bulk carrier into a mobile fish farming unit for domestic operator Senhai MK.\n\nThe vessel, Zhedai Yuyang 60001, was handed over by Shanhaiguan Shipbuilding, a unit of China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC), after an extensive retrofit project in Hebei Province.\n\nOriginally built in 1996 as a panamax bulker, the 225-m-long ship has been modified to include seven large aquaculture tanks in place of its former cargo holds.

Until now, FSB clearance was only required for ships entering ports near Russian naval bases. Under the new rules, all ships “en route from foreign ports” will be required to secure authorisation from an official representative of the FSB in coordination with the port captain.\n\nThe Kremlin has not provided a formal rationale for the move, but the decree cites a constitutional provision governing military conditions — a likely reference to ongoing martial law statutes in regions of Russia bordering Ukraine.\n\nThe announcement comes in the wake of a string of unexplained explosions targeting tankers linked to Russian trade, some occurring thousands of kilometres from Russian shores, most recently aboard StealthGas’s ammonia tanker Eco Wizard at the Ust-Luga energy hub earlier this month. That blast—officially described as a “minor leak”—triggered the evacuation of the vessel and temporary port closure. Damage inspection revealed large holes in the hull, with metal bent inward, fuelling speculation of an external attack.\n\nMaritime security experts and Western intelligence services have speculated that Ukraine may be escalating a covert sabotage campaign aimed at disrupting Russian oil exports. \n\nThe Eco Wizard blast followed similar incidents in February, when the Turkish-owned Koala was rocked by three explosions at Ust-Luga, and in June when the Vilamoura, a suezmax managed by TMS Tankers, was hit after calling at Russian ports.\n\nThe Ust-Luga incidents are part of a growing list of maritime explosions involving tankers linked to Russian trade, including outside the Baltic. In recent months, explosions on the Seajewel and Seacharm (both aframaxes managed by Thenamaris) in the Mediterranean, as well as the Grace Ferrum off Libya, have raised alarms among maritime security experts, many of whom suspect the use of limpet mines.\n\nIn December 2024, the Ursa Major, a Russian general cargo ship, sank in the western Mediterranean following an underwater explosion. While official statements have often downplayed these events, local authorities and international observers increasingly view them as a coordinated campaign against Russia’s export of fossil fuels.\n\nLast week, Russia’s state-run port operator FSUE Rosmorport announced a RUB3.16bn ($39.5m) tender to inspect the underwater sections of vessels at key Baltic Sea ports amid mounting concerns over maritime sabotage.\n\nThe string of blasts recorded in recent months will likely initiate a review of war risk premium rates for vessels calling Russian Baltic Sea ports, maritime security specialist Ambrey suggested earlier this month.
