- **Airline Filter**: Filter by specific airlines
- **Live Updates Toggle**: Enable/disable real-time position updates
- **Manual Refresh**: Force refresh flight data

### üì± Flight Details Panel
- Comprehensive flight information on click
- Aircraft type, altitude, speed, and heading
- Route information with progress tracking
- Estimated arrival/departure times
- Flight status and airline details

## Technical Implementation

### Data Sources
- **Sample Flight Data**: Real-time flight information with actual routes and aircraft
- **Simulated Flights**: Generated data for demonstration with realistic flight patterns
- **Airspace Data**: Accurate Singapore airspace boundaries and control zones

### Technologies Used
- **Leaflet.js**: Interactive mapping with custom styling
- **D3.js**: Data visualization and UI components
- **Real-time Updates**: Live position tracking with smooth animations
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile viewing

### Airspace Zones Implemented
1. **Flight Information Region (FIR)** - Orange dashed boundary
2. **Terminal Control Area (TCA)** - Cyan dashed boundary  
3. **Control Traffic Region (CTR)** - Red dashed boundary
4. **Traffic Corridors** - Purple dashed lines
